Hello, I'm Eclipso!

Say hi back to your bot buddy who helps you keep track of how you spend your day and reminds you when it's time to sleep. They come in the form of a browser extension AND app, so you can effectively manage your time using any device.

I've built a few static websites before, avoiding JavaScript every time. [More details coming soon!]
