                <p><i>Hello, I'm Eclipso!</i> I'm here to help you balance your time through sun and moon :D I come as a browser extension with a popup where you can start focus sessions that block distracting websites, as well as an options page to edit your preferences: what websites you'd like to block, and when you'd like to receive a bedtime nudge.</p>
                <p>--<br></p>
                <p>To use Eclipso, head on over to the Work tab and list the websites that you usually can't resist scrolling on. Whenever you sit down at your desk for a focus session, open the popup and set an amount of time that you want to spend on work. During that time, the websites will be off-bounds. You can also head to the Sleep tab and set a time at which you'd like to receive a reminder to put the device away and go to sleep. Hover over Eclipso in the bottom right corner if you need anything :D</p>
                <p>I built Eclipso because... well, in my mom's own words, I built this for myself. I needed it TT Besides that though, I was curious to try my hand in this after downloading a few other extensions and being unsatisfied with their features. Eclipso runs all the features I need in the the way I like best. I've also built many websites using HTML and CSS, but JavaScript was used sparingly. This was a real big push out of my comfort zone, from which I learned a lot and gained confidence. The nights spent on this are proof of it - but now that it's over, Eclipso is here to make sure I make up for that lost sleep TT</p>
                <p>Essentially, how the code works is that when a focus session is started in the popup, the end time of the focus session is calculated and shown in the popup as a timer as well as sent to the background.js file so it's not lost as soon as the popup is closed. Background.js uses the end time to send a notification when the focus session is over. Also, if the reset button is pressed, the timer is stopped and the end time is deleted from storage to not send that notification. During focus sessions, it checks the URLs of each tab so that if a website among the inputted list of blocked ones from the options page is opened, the tab is removed and a notification to stay on trach is sent. Another tab in the options page lets people choose a time to get a bedtime notification. This is again sent to background.js, where an alarm is set to trigger a notification either that day at the given time, or adding a day to the date if the time has already passed on the current day.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes when self-discipline is not enough, you just need a bit of help to stay on task.</p>
                    <p>With Eclipso's website blocker, you can make sure you stay locked in on work by inputting websites that you're not allowed to access during focus sessions. As long as the timer is running, the distracting tab will be closed for you and a nudging notification will be sent.</p>
                    <p>How the code works: when you start a focus session, Eclipso calculates and stores the time at which it will end as well as the list of blocked websites. Every time a tab is opened or changed, the code checks if its URL matches any of the blocked sites. If a match is found... DEATH BY DELETION.</p>
                    <p>Note that after you click "save", it will show "saaved!" for a few seconds before returning to the way it looked before. This doesn't mean the value has been lost :D it's all good!</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">Type in the websites that should be blocked during focus sessions! One per line:</p>
                    <textarea id="blocked-sites-input" class="textarea" rows="5" placeholder="e.g. discord.com&#10;pinterest.com"></textarea>
                    <button id="save-blocked-sites" class="button is-small">Save</button>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-words" data-tab="3">
                <p>Sleep is crucial to stay both physically and emotionally healthy. That's why it's really important to get a good night of sleep!</p>
                <p>Time flies when you're having fun, or when you're focused. Or maybe you're doomscrolling and you need a reminder that it's getting late. Eclipso will notify you to get ready for bed at the time you set here!</p>
                <p>How the code works: your input is saved in your browser's local storage and Eclipso calculates when that time occurs next to schedule a notification. The program listens for the alarm, when it'll show a notification, then sets another alarm for the next day. Aka, don't ruin a good night of sleep with a bad next one!</p>
                <p>Again, note that after you click "save", it will show "saaved!" for a few seconds before returning to the way it looked before. The notification will still pop up at that time a-okay until you change it.</p>
                <p>Enter the military time at which you'd like to receive a notification to go to sleep:</p>
                <input type="time" id="sleepTime" min="00:00" max="23:59" required>
                <button id="save-sleep-time" class="button is-small">Save</button>
